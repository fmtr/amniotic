The easiest way to get started is to:

# Install

--8<--
docs/addon-install-button.md
--8<--

- Install as an Addon, using the button above.
- If you're using a non-default address for Home Assistant on your network (i.e. not
  `homeassistant.local`), set that in the Addon configuration.
- Add some audio files to the Home Assistant `/media/Amniotic` directory.
- Add the [Lovelace Dashboard](install/dashboard.md)

# Usage

With the Addon and Dashboard installed:

- Keep the Default Theme selected while you're getting started.
- Select a Recording from the dropdown.
- Toggle to Enable the Recording.
- Select a Media Player to stream the Theme to.
- Click Stream to Media Player.
- Your Theme should start playing on your Media Player.
- You can now Enable additional Recordings in the Theme, modify their volume, etc., to create a custom mix.
- Note: there's also a Current Theme URL, for if you want to manually paste stream to a non-HA player, like a phone or something.
