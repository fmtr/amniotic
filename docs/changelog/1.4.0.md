## Features

- Add [YouTube audio stream downloader](../../recordings). You can now populate Recordings entirely from within the Home Assistant interface.
- Make [dashboard](../../install/dashboard) dynamic. The dashboard will now automatically show/hide certain sections depending on app state, show links to documentation, etc. So for example the Recording section will be hidden until some Recordings are available, the Stream section will only show if the current Theme is ready to stream, etc.
- Add YouTube download-related controls to the dashboard.
