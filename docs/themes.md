Amniotic lets you define multiple Themes, each of which you can stream to separate Media Player entities.

!!! note "What's a Theme?"
Theme here just means a custom, named mix of one or more Recordings, their relative volumes, etc. So a simple Theme might be called "Relaxing Sleep Sounds" and involve two Recordings: one Recording of Birdsong, for example, at 20% volume, mixed with a second Recording, say of white noise, at 12% volume.

# Creating Themes via Home Assistant Controls

Themes can be created, deleted, edited and played via the Lovelace Dashboard in Home Assistant. Switching between Themes with the Theme pull-down, you'll be able to edit them by choosing which Recordings are enabled for that Theme, set their relative volumes etc.

Themes persist, and are saved to disk when modified in any way.

When running for the first time, you'll have a single theme called **Default
**. You can add new Themes by entering a name into the **New Theme** control.
